2017-12-23 0.5.1.1

* Add awsSessionTokenAuth (in addition to the existing awsAuth) to
  support AWS Session Token Service (AWS STS) credentials. These look
  like regular AWS credentials but have an additional session token as
  a 3rd element. This mechanism is needed to be able to (a) use EC2
  instance profiles, (b) make calls form AWS Lambda, (c) is useful for
  delegated role access (assumeRole within and across accounts), and (d)
  enables MFA-protected access scenarios.
  See tests/AWS/IAM.hs for a test and simple example.
